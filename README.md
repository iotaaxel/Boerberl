* From [Google's C++ Style Guide - FileNames](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#File_Names): 
```
C++ files should end in .cc and header files should end in .h. Files that rely on being textually included at specific points should end in .inc (see also the section on self-contained headers).

Do not use filenames that already exist in /usr/include, such as db.h.

In general, make your filenames very specific. For example, use http_server_logs.h rather than logs.h. A very common case is to have a pair of files called, e.g., foo_bar.h and foo_bar.cc, defining a class called FooBar.
```

## Objective
Create a C++ function to process and efficiently store market data.

## Function Signature
```cpp 
void on_market_data(char const* data);
```

## Input Data Format
The function will receive a stream of strings with the following format:
```cpp 
<SYMBOL> <BID_PRICE> <ASK_PRICE> <BID_SIZE> <ASK_SIZE>\n
```
* Each item in the string is separated by a space.
* Each string is delimited by a newline (`\n`).

This represents the top-of-book snapshots of the current state of market data for a symbol.

## Requirements
1. Your code should parse the given data.
2. Implement a data structure that allows the user to retrieve the latest top-of-book market
data snapshot by symbol.
3. Aim for efficiency in both space and time complexity.
4. You can use the Standard Template Library (STL) for your solution.

## Optional (but recommended)
* Include unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation.
* Provide sample usage of your function.
* If necessary, include Makefiles or any build instructions.
* Include any additional documentation or comments to support or clarify the code.

## Submission Guidelines
* Ensure your code is well-commented and adheres to coding best practices.
* Include all necessary files and dependencies for building and running your solution.
* Submit your solution as a compressed folder containing all necessary files.

## Testing / Examples
* Sample data observed on [Yahoo Finance's Most Bought by Hedge Funds](https://finance.yahoo.com/u/yahoo-finance/watchlists/most-bought-by-hedge-funds/) is used to create a text file representing the input format.
